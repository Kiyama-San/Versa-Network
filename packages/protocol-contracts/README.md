# VersaChain Protocol Contracts

This package includes:
* Contracts that interact directly with the protocol (Connector, Versa token).
* Utilities and interfaces to make it easy to develop multichain dApps on VersaChain (VersaInteractor, VersaInterfaces, VersaTokenConsumer).

## Addresses

* TSS address: collectively held by Versa blockchain validators.
* TSS Updater address: a Gnosis multi-sig that's under an OpenZeppelin TimeLock for security and transparency. Eventually, the ownership of this role will be delegated to the TSS address.

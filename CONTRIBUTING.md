## Ways to contribute
The best way to get started with contributing is by reading through the Contributing Guide for the platform. This document outlines the guidelines that contributors should follow when making changes or submitting pull requests. After familiarizing yourself with the rules, you can then look at any open issues and pick one that you would like to work on. If you don't see any issues that interest you or fit your skillset, then consider creating your own issue or proposing a feature request.

There are many ways to contribute to Versa, writing code is one of them. Others are bug hunting, improving our docs, or being part of the network by running a node. More details on our node sale will be provided in the coming months.

## Opening a Pull Request

A few rules of thumb based on the size of your Pull Request:

* If it's small, like fixing a typo, just send it.
* If it's medium, like working on a feature or a bug, you may want to open an issue to chat with the maintainers before working on it.
* If it's big, do your best to split it into smaller ones.
